                            <p><strong>Why this is correct:</strong> <strong>EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)</strong> is well-known for its fast convergence time, which it achieves by pre-calculating backup routes. The primary, best path to a destination is called the **Successor**. A pre-qualified, loop-free backup path is called the **Feasible Successor**. If the Successor route fails, the router can immediately switch to the Feasible Successor without needing to recalculate the entire network topology, making it very efficient.</p>

If that path fails, they must run the algorithm again to find a new best path. They don't use the "feasible successor" terminology or concept.</li>
                                <li><strong>BGP:</strong> As the routing protocol for the internet, BGP uses a complex set of path attributes (like AS-Path, Local Preference) to determine the best path between different autonomous systems.

                            <p><strong>Why this is correct:</strong> <strong>Administrative Distance (AD)</strong> is a number (0-255) that a router uses to rank the trustworthiness of a routing source; a lower number is better. Since no dynamic protocol is used, the admin must use static routes. They can configure a "floating static route" by creating two static routes: one with the default AD (e.g., 1) and a backup route with a higher AD (e.g., 5). The router will install the primary route. If that route's interface goes down, the router removes it from the routing table and "floats" the backup route with the higher AD into place.</p>

                           <p><strong>Why these are correct:</strong> Environmental factors relate to the physical conditions of the surrounding area that can affect equipment operation.</p>
                           <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                               <li><strong>Humidity control:</strong> Too much humidity can cause condensation and corrosion on electronic components. Too little humidity increases the risk of electrostatic discharge (ESD), which can damage sensitive chips. Proper humidity control is critical.</li>
                               <li><strong>Power load:</strong> This is the total amount of electrical power the equipment will draw. It's an essential environmental factor to consider to ensure the building's circuits can safely handle the demand without overloading and causing power failures or fires.</li>
                           </ul>
                           <p class="mt-2"><strong>Why others are incorrect:</strong></p>
                            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                                <li><strong>Fire suppression system & UPS location:</strong> These are crucial safety and infrastructure planning items, but they are systems you install *into* the environment, not properties *of* the environment itself like temperature or humidity.</li>
                                <li><strong>Floor construction type:</strong> This relates to the physical support and weight capacity, a structural concern, not an environmental one.</li>
                                <li><strong>Proximity to nearest MDF:</strong> This is a logistical and network design consideration related to cabling distance, not an environmental factor.</li>
