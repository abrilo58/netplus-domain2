The primary, best path to a destination is called the **Successor**. A pre-qualified, loop-free backup path is called the **Feasible Successor**. If the Successor route fails, the router can immediately switch to the Feasible Successor without needing to recalculate the entire network topology, making it very efficient.</p>

                                <li><strong>BGP:</strong> As the routing protocol for the internet, BGP uses a complex set of path attributes (like AS-Path, Local Preference) to determine the best path between different autonomous systems.

Since no dynamic protocol is used, the admin must use static routes. They can configure a "floating static route" by creating two static routes: one with the default AD (e.g., 1) and a backup route with a higher AD (e.g., 5). The router will install the primary route. If that route's interface goes down, the router removes it from the routing table and "floats" the backup route with the higher AD into place.</p>

                            <p><strong>Why this is correct:</strong> Modern networks separate voice and data traffic into different VLANs for performance and security. A VoIP phone needs to send its traffic with a specific VLAN tag so the switch knows to place it on the **voice VLAN**. This is typically done by configuring a "voice VLAN" on the switch port, which tells the switch to accept tagged voice traffic from the phone while still allowing untagged data traffic from a PC plugged into the phone.</p>

                            <p><strong>Why this is correct:</strong> The 2.4GHz Wi-Fi band is divided into 11 channels (in North America), but each channel is 22MHz wide and overlaps with its neighbors. To avoid co-channel interference, you must select channels that are far enough apart. The only set of channels in the 2.4GHz band that do not overlap at all are **1, 6, and 11**. This is the standard best practice for deploying multiple access points in this frequency band.</p>

                            <p><strong>Why this is correct:</strong> The key requirement here is authenticating with a **RADIUS** server. This is the defining feature of **WPA-Enterprise** mode (also known as 802.1X). In this mode, users don't share a single password. Instead, each user authenticates with their own unique credentials (username/password or certificate), which are verified by a central RADIUS server. This provides much stronger security and individual accountability, which is necessary for accessing internal corporate resources.</p>

                            <p><strong>Why this is correct:</strong> A **plenum** is the space used for air circulation in heating and air conditioning systems, which is often the space above a drop ceiling or under a raised floor. Fire safety codes are very strict about these areas. **Plenum-rated cable** has a special fire-retardant jacket (usually made of Teflon) that burns at a higher temperature and emits less toxic smoke than standard PVC jackets. It is required by law in most commercial buildings for any cables run through plenum spaces.</p>

                            <p><strong>Why this is correct:</strong> The hot aisle/cold aisle design is the standard for data center cooling efficiency. Racks are arranged in rows where the fronts of the racks face each other (the cold aisle) and the backs of the racks face each other (the hot aisle). Cool air is pumped into the cold aisle. Equipment is installed to pull this cool air in through the **front** and expel hot exhaust out the **rear** into the hot aisle, where it is then returned to the air conditioning units. This prevents hot and cold air from mixing.</p>
